setClass("Person", 
         slots = c(
           name = "character", 
           age = "numeric"
         )
)

  john <- new("Person", name = "John Smith", age = NA_real_)

  is(john)

Generally, you should only use @ in your methods. If you’re working with someone else’s class, look for accessor functions that allow you to safely set and get slot values. As the developer of a class, you should also provide your own accessor functions. Accessors are typically S4 generics allowing multiple classes to share the same external interface.

Here we’ll create a setter and getter for the age slot by first creating generics with setGeneric():
  
  setGeneric("age", function(x) standardGeneric("age"))
setGeneric("age<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("age<-"))
And then defining methods with setMethod():
  
  setMethod("age", "Person", function(x) x@age)
setMethod("age<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@age <- value
  x
})

age(john) <- 50
age(john)
